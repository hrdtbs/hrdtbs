# About me

I am a human.

### drawing

I've been an illustrator for about 6 years, and there were times when I was a manga artist, but I'm better at drawing portraits. 

### programing

The first one I used was Unity (C#). After that, I learned knowledge around the Web while using Wordpress and Rails, and recently used React for work. Programming is a hobby for me.

### music

I can play a little piano and clarinet. I also worked on stage sounds and compositions, but I have no talent.
