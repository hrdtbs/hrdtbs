# About me

### drawing

I have been an illustrator for about 6 years, and also worked as a Manga artist, but I'm better at drawing portraits. 

### programing

The first I used as work was Unity (C#). After that, I learned web knowledge while using Wordpress and Rails, and nowadays I often use React/Node.js/Typescript.
